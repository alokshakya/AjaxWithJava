Explanation for the code

Go to Oracle database application --> find Run SQL Command Line and run it
You can run it by searching it and run it
----------------------------------------------------
Now run following commands to create user with the same name as given in ConnectionProvider.java
inside src --> connect package

now commands 
1. connect System/alok789;
(this command is to connect with system database login with system password 
which you have provided at the time of installing oracle database
In my case my admin username is 'System' and password is 'alok789' 
(for oracle admin username is always system for everyone)

2. create user mess_database_user identified by mess_database_user_password;

3. grant dba to mess_database_user;
-----------------------------------------------------------
now your work on Run SQL Command Line has ended.

go to directory C: drive
type cmd in addressbar to open cmd in C:\>
or you can run cmd from anywhere and set its directory to C:\
by command cd C:\

now run commands to import database from file=D:\MessDatabase.dmp
put this MessDatabase.dmp file in D:\ or provide the path of file at the time of import

type command in cmd setting directory to C:\ drive
1.C:\> imp

it will ask for username provide username which you have created from Run SQL 
in this case username is mess_database_username type it there and press enter

now it will ask for password provide password for this user which
 is identified by 'mess_database_user_password'
type it there and press enter

now it will ask for dmp file location with name
 type D:\MessDatabase.dmp
 
 now it will ask for buffer size you can provide between 8192 to 30720 
 type 8192 there and press enter
 
 now it will ask that you want contents only
 type no as we want table structure also.
 
  now it will ask for 4 more confirmations type yes at each place
  DONE!
  now your database is ready now you can run your application with database
